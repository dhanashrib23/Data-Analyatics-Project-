# Data-Analyatics-Project-
The project is based on the State wise study of data of women  population from 2011 to 2021.

# REDME for Project 
This project uses Python programming language and its libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib for analyzing and visualizing the data related to women population in India.

The project reads an excel file named "WOMEN DATA.xlsx" from a specified location using the pandas library. The data includes the women population of various states in India for the years 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021.

The project then uses the matplotlib library to plot bar graphs for each year's women population and the total women population until 2021. The bar graphs are plotted for each state, and the X-axis shows the state names, while the Y-axis shows the women population.

The project defines a function named "fun_label()" that sets the title and Y-axis label for the plotted graph.

The project's code is well-documented with comments that explain each line of code's purpose.

Overall, this project aims to provide insights into the women population of different states in India over the years and visualize the data in an easily understandable format.
